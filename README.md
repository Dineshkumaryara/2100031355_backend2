# Safertek Task

This repository contains a Python script for interacting with a MySQL database. The script allows you to perform various queries on the database, such as listing customers, finding orders, and calculating total spending by customers. Additionally, I attached the SQL code to set up the database (`data.sql`).

## Features

The script provides the following functionalities:

1. **List all customers**: Retrieve and display information about all customers in the database.
2. **Find all orders placed in January 2023**: Retrieve and display orders placed within January 2023.
3. **Get the details of each order**: Display details of each order, including the customer name, email, order date, and the products ordered.
4. **List the products purchased in a specific order**: Display the products and quantities for a specific order.
5. **Calculate the total amount spent by each customer**: Calculate and display the total amount each customer has spent.
6. **Find the most popular product**: Identify and display the most popular product based on the total quantity ordered.
7. **Get the total number of orders and the total sales amount for each month in 2023**: Display the number of orders and total sales amount for each month in 2023.
8. **Find customers who have spent more than a specific amount**: Retrieve and display customers who have spent more than a specified amount.
